# Reddit-Sentiment-Analysis
Introduction
This project aims to perform sentiment analysis on Reddit communities, focusing initially on r/Genshin_Impact. The goal is to enable companies and other entities to effectively understand and respond to user feedback on these forums.

# Implementation
A two-step process combining Large Language Models (LLM) with the VADER sentiment analysis tool is employed in this project: 
Use LLM to segment and categorize Reddit comments, identifying key topics and themes. 
Use VADER to assess the emotional tone of comments, rating then from extremely positve(+1) to extremely negative(-1).

# Visualization
The project includes an interactive dashboard that visually presents the analysis results. This dashboard offers insights into sentiment trends, categorized sentiments, and highlights specific topics.

# Data Usage and Ethics
Please note the following regarding data usage: 
The data is exclusively used for sentiment analysis and understanding community trends. I am not responsible for any misuse of the data beyond the scope of this project.
