Again, optimizer is the only way to get a definitive answer.\n\nThe ER -> Electro DMG talent makes Raiden kind of funky that way.  And yes, crit circlet.  That's way without Engulfing you only aim for 220 ER - more than that and you are sacrificing too many crit stats.",

Trying to make up 50% ER just from substats is kind of reaching for all but the people spending weeks just building her - at least not without really hamstringing how much crit you have.  With ER sands you can either ignore ER substats or just go for an additional 20, so you can focus entirely on crit and ATK stats.",
